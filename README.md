CRM AI Compiler

A compiler-inspired AI system that converts natural language product requirements into structured, validated, and executable application configurations.

This project is designed as a multi-stage software generation pipeline, not a simple prompt-to-output generator.
It transforms open-ended instructions into reliable configurations for:

-UI Schema
-API Schema
-Database Schema
-Authentication Rules
-Business Logic

Objective:-
The goal of this project is to behave like a compiler for software generation:

Natural Language
        ↓
Intermediate Representation
        ↓
Structured Schemas
        ↓
Validation
        ↓
Repair
        ↓
Executable Configuration

Unlike basic AI wrappers, this system focuses on:-
-Reliability
-Deterministic generation
-Validation
-Error repair
-Cross-layer consistency
-Execution awareness
-Features
-Multi-Stage Generation Pipeline

The system breaks generation into modular stages:-

User Prompt
    ↓
Intent Extraction
    ↓
System Design Layer
    ↓
Schema Generation
    ↓
Validation Engine
    ↓
Repair Engine
    ↓
Runtime Simulation
    ↓
Final Executable Config
Intent Extraction

Extracts structured intent from vague natural language input.

Example:
Input
Build a CRM with login, dashboard, analytics, and payments.
Extracted Intent
{
  "app_type": "CRM",
  "features": [
    "login",
    "dashboard",
    "analytics",
    "payments"
  ]
}
System Design Layer

Converts intent into application architecture.

Includes:-entities, pages, roles, permissions, workflows, Schema Generation

Generates:-
-UI Schema
-pages
-layouts
-components
-API Schema
-endpoints
-request methods
-validations
-Database Schema
-tables
-fields
-relationships
-Auth Schema
-roles
-permissions
-access control
-Validation Engine

The system validates:-
-JSON correctness
-required fields
-schema completeness
-cross-layer consistency
-missing references
-logical mismatches

Example:
API references "contacts"
but DB schema lacks "contacts" table
Repair Engine
Instead of blindly regenerating everything, the system repairs only the invalid parts.

Example:
Missing contacts table
→ auto-add contacts table

This improves:-
reliability, latency, consistency, Runtime, Simulation

The system validates execution readiness by simulating:-
-API routes
-database availability
-auth compatibility
-UI connectivity-
This ensures output is directly usable by a runtime system.

Tech Stack:-
Frontend- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend- Node.js, Express
Validation- AJV
Deployment- Render
Version Control- GitHub
AI Integration-	Gemini API (planned/optional)

The system handles:-
vague prompts, conflicting requirements, missing details, incomplete specifications

Example:

Input
Build an app
Response
{
  "clarification_needed": true,
  "questions": [
    "What type of app?",
    "What features are required?"
  ]
}


The project includes:-
10 real-world prompts
10 edge-case prompts

Metrics tracked:-
-success rate
-retries
-repair count
-latency
-validation failures
-Deterministic Generation

The system is designed for stable outputs using:-
-modular generation
-schema constraints
-validation contracts
-structured intermediate representation
-low-temperature AI generation

Goal:-
-Same Input → Consistent Output
-Cost vs Quality Tradeoff
-Approach	Cost	Reliability
-Single Prompt Generation	Low	Poor
-Multi-Stage Pipeline	Medium	High
-Validation + Repair	Slightly Higher	Strong Reliability

How To Run Locally-
Install Dependencies
npm install
Start Server
npm start
Open Browser
http://localhost:3000

Deployment-
The project is deployed on Render.

Every GitHub push automatically triggers redeployment on render.

Future Improvements
Real Gemini/OpenAI integration
Automatic frontend generation
Runtime code generation
Docker deployment
Multi-tenant support
YAML export
React frontend
